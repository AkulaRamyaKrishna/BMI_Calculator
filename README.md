# BMI Calculator (Python)

A simple BMI calculator implemented in Python.

## Features
- Calculates BMI using height (in inches) and weight (in pounds)
- Categorizes BMI (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.)
- Modular design: logic in `body_metrics.py`, interactive notebook in `bmi_calculator.ipynb`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `bmi_calculator.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells and follow prompts

## Learning Outcome
- Modular programming in Python
- Using Python functions for real-life calculations
- Working with Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding
